### *Summary*

*Mapping Police Violence* visualizes data on police killings across the United States to reveal the impact of police violence within communities. The site contains a map, charts, graphs, and statistics that cover the 8,000 killings by police from 2013 onward. Through these visuals, the project directors’ purpose is to provide awareness of police violence patterns.

### *Design*

The data within the site was sourced from three comprehensive databases on police killings: FatalEncounters.org, the U.S. Police Shootings Database, and KilledbyPolice.net. Additional research was conducted to enrich the data, including searching criminal record databases and police reports. The police violence map was built using a combination of mapping software platforms, including OpenStreetMap, MapTiler, and CARTO. The various graphs and charts throughout the site were created with Tableau.

### *Relevance*

*Mapping Police Violence* utilizes mapping and graphing technologies to visualize data that raises awareness of a social justice issue pervasive within communities across the country. These visuals make data more digestible to the public, highlighting police violence patterns that would be difficult to gather from raw data alone. 

### *Findings*

The website contains seven tabs that are easy to navigate: “Police Violence Map,” “Compare Places,”“National Trends,”“Police Scoreboard,” “Year-End Police Violence Report,” “About the Data,” and “Planning Team.”

The central focus of the website is the police violence map, which obtains plotted points across the United States of police killings from December 2019 to December 2020. Each point contains information about the victim and the circumstances surrounding their death.

While the plotted points entail comprehensive information about the incident, there are usability issues. First, the map is sensitive, repeatedly zooming in and out if the cursor is placed on the map while trying to scroll down the page. Second, the plotted points are continuously highlighted in order of when the incident occurred, which distracted me as I tried to evaluate the points. While I could pause this function, large yellow circles remained on the points it was paused on. Finally, the search feature allows one to examine specific locations, but the search must be precise as typing in a zip code took me to another part of the world. Since the map shows police killings within the United States, it does not seem necessary to have the entire world mapped out. 

The rest of the site includes informative charts, graphs, and statistics on police killings. Graphs in the “Compare Places” tab that show police killings by state and city department were especially easy to interpret, allowing me to notice racial disparities in police killings through a color coded racial breakdown. However, a consistent issue with graphs across the site was their small size. Some can be made full-screen, but there is no zoom feature to look at specific points. 

Another issue pertains to a graph on the homepage titled “Police Are Killing People at Similar Rates as in Past Years.” While it is interesting to evaluate the police killing trends per year once filtering for race or armed status, the graph was not always easy to evaluate due to the overlapping lines I could not zoom in on.

I got a clearer picture of the police killings per year through clicking on the pencil icon to isolate a particular year. However, the pencil icon is not easily visible, only appearing when I hovered over the color coded key. Additionally, the only way to see annual killings is to move the cursor to the end of the year’s line. Even then, sometimes I was unable to see the total because the key got in the way. It would be helpful if there was a feature that presented the annual killings alongside the graph.

An aspect of the site I enjoyed was the search tool at the bottom of the homepage, where one can examine police killings by department or state. After searching, a number of people killed by the police appears along with various colored dots containing information such people’s names and descriptions. You can further filter these dots by race or armed status, and the dots will change their grouping. This interactive component is visually pleasing and informative, however the dots are close together, so it would be easy to miss one when hovering the cursor over them.

Overall, *Mapping Police Violence* does a nice job of using visualization technologies such as maps and graphs to reveal trends in police killings across the country. The variety of data visualizations ultimately creates a well-informed site that allows users to interact with data and notice patterns of police violence that impact numerous communities.
